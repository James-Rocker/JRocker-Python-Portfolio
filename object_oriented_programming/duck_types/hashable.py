To resolve this, we need to overwrite the __hash__ method in the class. 
The python method __hash__ truncates the value returned from an objectâ€™s

__eq__ and __hash__ must agree - equal objects must have equal hashes. 
the __hash__ value should just return the hash function with an arg of the tuple

As you can see, if you change the default __eq__ behaviour, you'll need to modify the __hash__ value
otherwise you'll come into issues later
